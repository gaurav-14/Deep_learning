Play the bag file: rosbag play bagfilename.bag
Run the following command from directory where you want to store the image.
	rosrun image_view extract_images _image_transport:=compressed _file_format:=frame%03i.jpg 
	_sec_per_frame:=7 /image/compressed:=/camera_a0

For resizing image to a particular fixed size:
Modify path to the image folder in resize.py script
Run the script: python resize.py

For Annotation:
Create a class.txt file containing multi-class name which you want to annotate.
Use main.py by giving appropriate image directory and label directory in it.
Run: python main.py from scripts folder.
Create Bounding Box and give class name to each from drop-down menu provided of GUI.
All labeled files will be stored in the label directory you have provided in main.py

For converting to tfrecord format use:
First create train.records file and give it write permission.
Execute:  python convert.py path_to_image_dir  path_to_label_dir path_to_recordfile
          E.g.: python2.7 convert.py ../Images/003 ../Labels/003 ../003.tfrecords
